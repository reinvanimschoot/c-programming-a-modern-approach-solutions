### Exercise 4.15

Give the values of `i` and `j` after each of the following expression statements
has been executed. (Assume that `i` has the value 1 initially and `j` has the
value 2.)

(a) `i += j;`  
(b) `i--;`  
(c) `i * j / i;`  
(d) `i % ++j;`

### Solution

`i = 1`
`j = 2`

(a) `i = 3`, `j = 2`
(b) `i = 0`, `j = 2`
(b) `i = 1`, `j = 2`
(b) `i = 1`, `j = 3`
