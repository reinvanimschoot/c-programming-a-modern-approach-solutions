### Exercise 06

Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent
underscore (as in `current___balance`, for example)?

### Solution

It makes it difficult to identify the amount of underscores that are used and subsequently makes it more difficult to read the identifier. Hence, it serves no real purpose or benefit.
