### Exercise 13

Assume that a program contains the following declarations:

```c
char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5;
```

Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.

(a) `c * i`  
(b) `s + m`  
(c) `f / c`  
(d) `d / s`  
(e) `f - d`  
(f) `(int) f`

### Solution

(a) `int`  
(b) `long`  
(c) `float`  
(d) `double`  
(e) `double`  
(f) `int`
