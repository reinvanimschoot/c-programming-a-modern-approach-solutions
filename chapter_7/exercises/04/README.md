### Exercise 04

If `c` is a variable of type `char`, which one of the following statements is
illegal?

(a) `i += c; /* i has type int */`  
(b) `c = 2 * c - 1;`  
(c) `putchar(c);`  
(d) `printf(c);`

### Solution

(d) is an illegal statement since `printf` takes a string as argument and not a char.
