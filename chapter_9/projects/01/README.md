### Project 01

Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of integers (which it
stores in an array), then sorts the integers by calling the function
`selection_sort`. When given an array with _n_ elements, `selection_sort` must
do the following: 1. Search the array to find the largest element, then move it to the last
position in the array.  
 2. Call itself recursively to sort the first _n_ - 1 elements of the array.

### Solution

See `01.c`.
